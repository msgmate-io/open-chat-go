## Open-Chat Go-Server

> ⚠️ this is very early stage & I'm pretty much learning 'go' along the way so don't exprect to much here yet

A re-write of the [open-chat api spec](https://beta.msgmate.io/api/schema/swagger-ui/)
but in go.

Reasons are mainly portability & the future ability to re-write the api to interace as matrix-client.

### Software choices

- ORM via gorm
- Chi-Go as server
